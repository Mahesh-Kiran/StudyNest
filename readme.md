\# 📚 StudyNest



\*A place where students finally stop asking “Sir, notes send?”\*

\## 🚀 Overview



StudyNest is my attempt at ending the legendary WhatsApp note-requesting marathon in college.  

Instead of chasing lecturers or spamming class groups, students can now access all study resources in one place.



\- Lecturers upload  

\- Students download  

\- Admins… well, they enjoy power 😎



Basically — a clean, organized study material hub that just works.

\## 🎯 Why I Made This



Because chaos is not a learning system.  

And because if I had to hear “Bro PDF share cheyyara” one more time… 🧨



This project solves:



✅ Scattered notes everywhere  

✅ Students begging lecturers for PDFs  

✅ Staff forwarding the same file 50 times  

✅ My sanity slowly fading  



So yes, digital peace achieved.
